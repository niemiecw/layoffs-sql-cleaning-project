# 🧹 SQL Data Cleaning Project – Tech Layoffs Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete SQL data cleaning process using a real-world inspired dataset of tech layoffs. The focus is on transforming messy CRM-like data into a clean and analysis-ready table using SQL operations.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Many companies collect valuable business data (e.g., layoffs, leads, sales), but it’s often **duplicated, inconsistent, or incomplete**. This project shows how to:
- Remove duplicate entries
- Standardize formats (company names, countries, industries)
- Fix nulls and structural issues
- Prepare the data for reporting or analysis

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

Sample data includes:
- Company name and location
- Industry
- Layoff count and percentage
- Fundraising data
- Country and funding stage
- Layoff date

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- SQL (MySQL)
- Workbench (

---

## 🧠 Key SQL Operations

- `ROW_NUMBER()` for de-duplication
- `TRIM()` for whitespace cleanup
- `UPDATE` + `JOIN` to fill missing values
- `STR_TO_DATE()` for date standardization
- `DELETE` for null rows
- `ALTER TABLE` to finalize structure
